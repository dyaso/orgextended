* 1.2.50
** Agenda
*** FIXED Task Lists
	- Some print cleanup from the sublime output window.

*** FIXED Agenda View
	- Searchable task lists broke the agenda render. Very frustrating.

*** New showeffort todo agenda option 
    
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "Active":   ["Todos: tagfilter +Active :showeffort"],
    #+END_SRC 

    This will add the :EFFORT: property if present on a todo to the todo list view in a column

*** New showid todo agenda option

	Will show the ID or CUSTOM_ID property of a task in the todo list
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "Active":   ["Todos: tagfilter +Active :showid"],
    #+END_SRC 

*** New showafter todo agenda option

	Will show the AFTER property of a task in the todo list
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "Active":   ["Todos: tagfilter +Active :showafter"],
    #+END_SRC 

*** New showassigned todo agenda option

	Will show the ASSIGNED property of a task in the todo list
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
        "Active":   ["Todos: tagfilter +Active :showassigned"],
    #+END_SRC 
*** Change in TODO Tables
	- As I have added more columns it becomes more confusing deciphering what you are looking at. I have added headings to the table.
	- I may simply convert this to an org table, we will see.

** Todo Views
	- Org Agenda * commands now work on todo views as well as the agenda
	- This allows for changing priority et al directly form todo lists.
	- 3 new commands for todo view editing:
		- Add tag from view
		- Add property EFFORT
		- Add property ASSIGNED
 
		These get us closer to a pseudo column view mode using a todo table.

** Tables
   - Fixed some tabbing problems (mostly highlight related in some generated tables)
   - Problem was both a potential exception AND a table living at global scope
     the keybinding was going to the global scope tab binding rather than the
     table keybinding which was causing improper behaviour.

*** Random Insertion From Remote Table
	Sometimes I would like to make a random selection from a remote table. There is a new command to insert at point a random selection from a remote table (by ID)
	NOTE the properties block with ID this lets you reference this table and make a random selection from the table.

** Timechart
    - New experimental feature. Much like an agenda we have the timechart. This is a table that can be inserted anywhere from todo's.
      Much like a clocktable dynamic block / report. 
      However this maps effort vs spent, who has been assigned to a task (if desired) and done tasks, more than your standard clock report.
    - My thought is to make it possible to dump out one of these and eventually automatically output as several gantt chart options as well.
    - First version is outputting to mermaid. It is not fully ready for consumption but can be experimented with for those that are adventurous.
