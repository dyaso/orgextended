* 1.2.51
** FIXED Date only labels were confounding some TODO reports causing an assert.
   - This would manifest as a blank todo list when the todo had a date but no time, this has been fixed


** Timesheet / Timechart
   Still an experimental feature

   - Org Choose Timesheet command acts like Agenda Choose View and uses the same list.


** Todo view rebinds:
	These allow editing of task state in a todo view which is handy for planning purposes

*** New Agenda Todo List Type
    Has Status - Lists all todos regardless of status or presence in a project. Useful if you want to filter you tasks by tag or property instead
