** FIXED Mermaid JS source blocks

  The mermaid source block handler was using an old default command line for mermaid.
  You should now specify mmdc.ps1 on windows:

  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    "mermaid": "C:\Users\ihdav\node_modules\.bin\mmdc.ps1", 
  #+END_SRC

  On windows this will allow the following to run properly
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC mermaid :file mermaidout.png
  flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop	
  #+END_SRC

** FIXED Org Capture
   - If the user had a list as their dayPagePath variable org capture would crash.
     Improved symbol expansion reliability a little bit.
   - File creation in directory that does not exists was not working. This should now be fixed
   - [[https://reg.ca][Reg Ca]] Org link

** FIXED Reveal JS Exporter
   Reveal js had moved on since the last time I used the exporter. Derusting is required to get it
   functional again.

   - [x] Reveal js exporter was missing Escape method of embedded source blocks

   Please note when using reveal exporter that if slides have to much content they will become jumbled.
   The layout is somewhat simplistic
