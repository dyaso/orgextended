* 1.2.53
** FIXED Mermaid JS source blocks

  The mermaid source block handler was using an old default command line for mermaid.
  You should now specify mmdc.ps1 on windows:

  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    "mermaid": "C:\Users\ihdav\node_modules\.bin\mmdc.ps1", 
  #+END_SRC

  On windows this will allow the following to run properly
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC mermaid :file mermaidout.png
  flowchart TD
    Start --> Stop	
  #+END_SRC

** FIXED Org Capture
   - If the user had a list as their dayPagePath variable org capture would crash.
     Improved symbol expansion reliability a little bit.

** FIXED Reveal JS Exporter
   Reveal js had moved on since the last time I used the exporter. Derusting is required to get it
   functional again.

   - [x] Reveal js exporter was missing Escape method of embedded source blocks
   - [ ] Reveal js exporter had regressed with links, they were not active.
   - [ ] Reveal js exporter had regressed with sub pages not showing up properly (overlaid rather than hidden state)

   - [ ] Test mermaid on mac
   - [ ] Test orgcapture on mac
   - [ ] Test reveal on mac

   - [ ] Update docs release notes
